# Second attempt at LCD driver by I2C

This was RIWS's second attempt to send I2C commands to an LCD with a chip based on HD44780

I wasn't able to make it work. Perhaps there was a soldering error on the i2c adaptor connection to the main LCD board (which another internet user had). 

Based on Espressif's i2c_lcd_2 sample project
